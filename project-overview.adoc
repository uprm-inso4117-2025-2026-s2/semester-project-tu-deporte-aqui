= Project Overview & Problem Statement

== Introduction

Tu Deporte Aquí is a mobile-first, web-based platform designed to centralize sports information for local Puerto Rico leagues. The system addresses a critical gap in the accessibility, consistency, and reliability of sports data within the Puerto Rican sports ecosystem.

== Problem Statement

Sports information in Puerto Rico is highly fragmented across multiple informal and semi-structured sources such as:

* League websites
* Social media pages
* Independent reporters and fan accounts

These sources often provide:

* Delayed updates
* Incomplete information
* Conflicting data (e.g., different reported scores)
* Lack of verification or official confirmation

As a result, users cannot reliably depend on a single source for accurate and timely sports information. This creates confusion, reduces trust, and negatively impacts the overall user experience.

== Context: Puerto Rico Sports Environment

Unlike major international or U.S. mainland leagues, many Puerto Rico sports leagues:

* Do not provide official APIs
* Lack standardized data publishing formats
* Rely heavily on manual updates and social media
* Have inconsistent reporting frequency

This environment introduces significant uncertainty in data collection and validation.

== Project Purpose

The purpose of Tu Deporte Aquí is to:

* Aggregate sports data from multiple available sources
* Improve accessibility of local sports information
* Provide a centralized platform for users
* Emphasize transparency in data reliability rather than assuming perfect accuracy

The system is not designed to guarantee real-time or fully verified data, but instead to clearly communicate the quality and reliability of the information presented.

== Reliability-First Philosophy

A key design principle of the system is a reliability-first approach.

Instead of hiding inconsistencies or failures, the system will:

* Explicitly indicate when data is delayed or outdated
* Highlight conflicting information from different sources
* Show when data is incomplete or unavailable
* Avoid silent failures

This approach prioritizes user trust over perceived system perfection.

== Scope Alignment

Consistent with the project scope:

* The system focuses on local Puerto Rico sports leagues
* National and international leagues are excluded in Phase 1
* Data sources may be unofficial or semi-structured
* Real-time guarantees are not required

This ensures alignment with the constraints defined in the System Scope & Boundaries document.

== Summary

Tu Deporte Aquí aims to improve how users access sports information in Puerto Rico by addressing fragmentation and reliability challenges. The system focuses on transparency, consistency, and clear communication of uncertainty, forming a foundation for future development and testing of reliability-focused features.
