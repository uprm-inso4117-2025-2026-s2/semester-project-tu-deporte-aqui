== 3.1 Concept Analysis

=== Purpose

This section analyzes the key conceptual elements that define the behavior,
structure, and reliability characteristics of Tu Deporte Aquí.

The analysis focuses on how uncertainty, conflicting information, and informal
data sources influence system design decisions.

=== Core Concepts

==== Sports Information Entity

Sports information represents data related to games, teams, leagues, standings,
scores, schedules, and events.

This information may originate from multiple sources with varying reliability
levels.

==== Data Sources

Data sources include:

* League websites
* Social media updates
* News outlets
* Community reports

Sources may differ in accuracy, timeliness, and structure.

==== Reliability State

The reliability state represents the confidence level of a piece of data.

Possible states include:

* Confirmed
* Provisional
* Conflicting
* Missing
* Stale

==== Timestamp and Freshness

Each data element includes temporal metadata indicating when the information
was last updated.

Freshness indicators help users interpret reliability.

=== Concept Relationships

==== Source to Data Relationship

Multiple sources may provide information about the same event.

The system must support:

* Source attribution
* Conflict detection
* Priority rules

==== Reliability Interpretation

Reliability states influence:

* User interface indicators
* System decision logic
* Validation behavior

==== User Trust Impact

Transparent communication of uncertainty improves user trust and reduces
misinterpretation of data.

=== Conceptual Constraints

==== Informal Data Environment

Tu Deporte Aquí operates in an environment where:

* Official APIs may not exist
* Data may be delayed
* Conflicts are common

System concepts must accommodate these constraints.

==== Mobile-First Context

Concept design must prioritize:

* Compact information display
* Clear status indicators
* Fast interpretation

=== Summary

Concept analysis provides a structured understanding of the domain elements
that influence system reliability, transparency, and behavior.

These concepts guide later modeling and validation activities.
