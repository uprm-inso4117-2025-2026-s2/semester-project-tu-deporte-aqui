* Official league websites are the most trustworthy source of data.
* Social media is useful for confirmation but unreliable as a primary source.

* Local leagues may lack public APIs, making automation challenging.
* Combining multiple sources increases reliability but introduces the need for conflict resolution mechanisms.
