== Research: Handling of Delayed, Conflicting, or Missing Live Game Data
Author: Angel A. Villegas Colon

== 1. Handling Delayed Live Updates

=== NBA Platform

Observed behavior:

* Displays a live game clock and score.
* If updates are delayed, the clock may visually pause.
* Clearly shows “End of Quarter” or “Halftime” to prevent confusion.
* Does not explicitly display “data delayed,” but avoids presenting uncertain values.

Observed Strategy:

* Freeze the last confirmed data.
* Avoid displaying speculative or estimated updates.
* Maintain structured game states (Q1, Q2, Halftime, Final).

=== ESPN Platform

Observed behavior:

* Displays timestamp indicators such as “Final” or “Live.”
* Occasionally shows “Delayed” during broadcast interruptions.
* Uses structured status labels (Scheduled, Live, Final).

Observed Strategy:

* Clearly label the game state.
* Avoid partial or incomplete updates.
* Maintain consistent formatting even if data pauses.

== 2. Handling Conflicting Scores Across Sources

Neither the NBA nor ESPN publicly display conflicts between sources.

Observed Industry Strategy:

* Use a primary trusted data provider.
* Do not display multiple score versions.
* Update scores only after verification.
* Perform silent backend reconciliation (users do not see conflicts).

Key Insight:

Major platforms resolve discrepancies internally before updating the user interface. Conflicting information is never exposed to users.

== 3. Handling Missing or Incomplete Information

=== NBA Platform

Observed behavior:

* If statistics are unavailable, fields are hidden.
* Play-by-play sections may temporarily show “No plays available.”
* No placeholders are shown with incorrect data.

=== ESPN Platform

Observed behavior:

* Displays “No data available” in certain statistics sections.
* Uses structured fallback states such as dashes or blank values.
* Maintains layout consistency even if data is missing.

Observed Strategy:

* Avoid displaying inaccurate placeholders.
* Clearly label unavailable sections.
* Preserve UI structure to prevent confusion.

== 4. Communicating Uncertainty or Provisional Data

Common approaches observed across platforms:

* Use clear game state labels (Live, Final, Scheduled).
* Apply timestamp-based validation (e.g., “Final” locks the score).
* Avoid speculative updates.
* Do not display confidence percentages.
* Maintain a clean UI without technical error messages.

Key Pattern Across Platforms:

Transparency is achieved through structured status labels rather than technical explanations.

== 5. Summary of Practical Approaches

|===
| Scenario | Common Strategy

| Delayed Updates
| Freeze last confirmed data and maintain game state labels

| Conflicting Scores
| Resolve internally before updating UI

| Missing Data
| Hide or clearly label sections as unavailable

| Uncertainty
| Use structured status indicators (Live, Final, Scheduled)

== 6. Key Findings for System Design

* A single trusted source should be prioritized.
* Conflicts should be resolved internally, not displayed to users.
* Clear game status labeling is critical.
* Missing data should be labeled rather than guessed.
* UI stability builds user trust more effectively than raw update speed.
