===== Overview

During the development of the Tu Deporte Aquí documentation, the team made limited and responsible use of generative artificial intelligence tools as supplementary support resources. These tools were used to assist with organization, drafting clarity, and conceptual exploration, but they did not replace the team’s own analysis, understanding, or decision-making. All final material included in this document reflects the work and judgment of the project members.

===== Tools Used

The primary tools used were publicly available generative AI systems, including ChatGPT (OpenAI) and DeepSeek. Only free or standard access versions were utilized, without any specialized training, plugins, or proprietary datasets. These tools were treated as general-purpose assistants similar to reference materials, writing aids, or brainstorming tools.

===== Purpose of AI Assistance

AI support was incorporated mainly during early and intermediate stages of documentation development. Its use focused on:

• Generating initial organizational structures for sections  
• Suggesting ways to express technical ideas more clearly  
• Assisting with refinement of explanations and terminology  
• Providing alternative phrasings to improve readability  
• Supporting brainstorming of possible approaches or considerations  
• Helping ensure consistency in formatting across large sections of documentation  

In some technical areas, AI tools were also used to produce preliminary draft text that served as a starting point for further development by the team.

===== Human Ownership and Contribution

All content was critically reviewed, edited, and refined by the Tu Deporte Aquí team members. The team provided the project context, interpreted requirements, evaluated suggestions, and made all final decisions regarding what material would be included.

AI outputs were never accepted without modification. Instead, they were treated as rough drafts or suggestions that required validation and adaptation. The intellectual responsibility for the documentation—including correctness, coherence, and alignment with project goals—remains entirely with the human authors.

The team ensured that each section accurately reflected their own understanding of the system, course concepts, and engineering principles rather than relying on automated generation alone.

===== Verification and Quality Control

To maintain academic integrity and technical reliability, the team followed a verification process when using AI assistance. This included:

• Reviewing AI-generated explanations for logical consistency  
• Cross-checking technical concepts against course materials and official documentation  
• Confirming that terminology and assumptions matched the project context  
• Correcting any inaccuracies, ambiguities, or unsupported claims  
• Ensuring that final content remained aligned with project requirements and milestones  

When AI suggestions were incomplete, unclear, or incorrect, they were either revised or discarded.

===== Academic Integrity Considerations

The team recognizes that generative AI tools can produce convincing but inaccurate information. For this reason, AI was treated strictly as a support tool rather than an authoritative source. The responsibility for originality, accuracy, and academic honesty remained with the team at all times.

The final documentation represents original work developed by the project members, with AI serving only as a facilitator for efficiency and clarity.

===== Reflection on Learning

The use of generative AI tools contributed positively to productivity by accelerating brainstorming and helping structure complex documentation. More importantly, it encouraged critical evaluation skills, since team members needed to assess whether generated content was correct, relevant, and appropriate.

This process reinforced an important engineering practice: tools can assist development, but professional judgment and accountability cannot be delegated. The team views AI as a supportive resource that enhances learning when used responsibly and thoughtfully.

===== Conclusion

Generative AI tools were used in a limited, transparent, and supportive role throughout this project. The Tu Deporte Aquí team maintains full responsibility for the final documentation, its accuracy, and its alignment with course objectives.
