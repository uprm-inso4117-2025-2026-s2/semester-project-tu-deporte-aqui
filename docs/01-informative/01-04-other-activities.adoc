
=== 1.4 Other Activities than Development

===== Purpose

Milestone 1 of Tu Deporte Aquí emphasizes documentation, research, and structured system preparation rather than implementation. This section describes the non-development activities that contribute to system reliability, transparency, and organized collaboration.

These activities ensure that the project evolves through disciplined engineering practices before any source code is written.

===== Research Activities

Research plays a central role in Milestone 1. Key research efforts include:

- Investigating reliability strategies for conflicting and delayed sports data
- Defining scope boundaries and out-of-scope conditions
- Exploring data lineage and audit trail strategies
- Studying transparency indicators for uncertain information
- Analyzing requirements classification (functional vs non-functional)

These research tasks ensure that system behavior is well-defined under real-world constraints.

===== Documentation-as-Code

The project adopts a documentation-as-code model using AsciiDoc and GitHub.

This includes:

- Structured folder hierarchy under /docs
- Modular section files linked through include:: directives
- Version-controlled documentation
- Pull-request-based content integration
- Automated HTML/PDF build via CI workflow

This approach ensures traceability, consistency, and reproducibility of documentation.

===== Pull Request and Review Process

All contributions are integrated through a PR-only workflow.

The process includes:

1. Issue creation using the standardized template
2. Feature branch creation
3. Focused modification of assigned section
4. Pull request submission
5. Automated CI build verification
6. Team Lead review
7. Manager approval and merge

This structured process ensures quality control and accountability.

===== CI/CD and Build Automation

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that:

- Compiles the master AsciiDoc document
- Verifies include structure
- Generates HTML and PDF artifacts
- Detects build or formatting errors

This automation ensures documentation integrity before approval.

===== Task Tracking and Governance

All work is tracked through GitHub Issues.

Each issue includes:

- Clear objective
- Defined acceptance criteria
- Urgency and difficulty rating
- Assigned contributor
- Milestone linkage

Documentation scaffold sections reference the master issue (#53) to maintain structural traceability.

This governance structure prevents duplication and supports milestone compliance.

===== Team Coordination

Collaboration is supported through:

- Team-based specialization (five domain-focused teams)
- Regular coordination discussions
- Milestone planning
- Alignment on scope and assumptions
- Shared responsibility for reliability modeling

These coordination practices ensure consistent interpretation of requirements across teams.

===== Milestone Planning and Retrospectives

Milestone 1 includes:

- Clear completion criteria
- Defined deliverables (compiled documentation)
- Explicit failure and uncertainty modeling
- Iterative refinement through feedback

Retrospective reflection ensures continuous improvement in documentation quality and team workflow.

===== Conclusion

Tu Deporte Aquí extends beyond software implementation. Research, structured documentation, governance modeling, and automated validation form the foundation of the project.

These non-development activities ensure that when implementation begins, it is grounded in clearly defined scope, reliability expectations, and transparent engineering practices.
