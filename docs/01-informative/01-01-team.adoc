== 1.1 Team

=== Project Organization

Tu Deporte Aquí is organized into five specialized teams to support structured documentation, research, and feature preparation during Milestone 1.

Milestone 1 does not involve implementation or source code development. The focus is on defining scope, system behavior, reliability expectations, and transparency requirements for a mobile-first platform serving local Puerto Rico sports.

Each team is responsible for a clearly defined domain area to ensure full coverage of system expectations before development begins.

=== Team Structure

==== Team 1 – Core Documentation & Project Standards

Responsible for establishing the official documentation foundation:

- Expanding the A3 into a structured project overview
- Defining scope boundaries (local leagues only)
- Documenting assumptions (limited or no official APIs; reliance on informal sources)
- Maintaining the main README and documentation index
- Defining shared glossary and documentation standards
- Configuring AsciiDoc build automation
- Preparing the final compiled Milestone 1 documentation

This team ensures documentation consistency, structure, and governance.

==== Team 2 – Live Games & Match Coverage

Defines how live game information is displayed and trusted:

- What data is shown (scores, time, league, status)
- Handling delayed updates
- Resolving conflicting score reports
- Behavior when information is missing
- Mobile-first UI messaging for provisional data

This team focuses on reliability under real-world uncertainty.

==== Team 3 – Standings & Tournament Progress

Defines how standings are calculated and communicated:

- Representation of local league standings
- Handling inconsistencies across informal sources
- Resolving or flagging conflicting standings
- Displaying provisional or uncertain rankings
- Managing edge cases (postponements, incomplete data)

This team ensures structural integrity of league progression information.

==== Team 4 – Teams & Athletes Profiles

Defines expectations for profile information accuracy:

- Required and optional profile fields
- Acceptable levels of staleness
- Handling incomplete or outdated data
- Mobile-friendly indicators for uncertain information

This team focuses on data completeness and freshness constraints.

==== Team 5 – News, Alerts & System Transparency

Defines how system updates and uncertainty are communicated:

- Criteria for publishing news vs urgent alerts
- Handling unverified or conflicting reports
- Transparency indicators (last update time, confidence level)
- Messaging during degraded or uncertain states

This team ensures user trust and system transparency.

=== Roles and Responsibilities

==== Developers

Developers are responsible for:

- Creating and completing GitHub issues
- Conducting research aligned with team goals
- Writing structured documentation
- Following the Issue Creation Guidelines
- Submitting work through pull requests
- Ensuring acceptance criteria are satisfied

All work must be issue-based and documented.

==== Team Leads

Team Leads:

- Coordinate work within their assigned team
- Conduct first-level review of completed issues
- Ensure alignment with Milestone 1 objectives
- Track participation and progress

Team Leads help maintain quality and consistency before escalation to managers.

==== Managers

Managers:

- Review issue clarity and completeness
- Assign urgency and difficulty levels
- Approve pull requests after review
- Close issues upon satisfactory completion
- Ensure milestone alignment and fairness

Managers ensure governance and structured progression of the project.

=== Workflow and Governance

The project follows an issue-driven and PR-only workflow with branch protection enabled.

All work must begin with a GitHub Issue created using the standardized Issue Creation Guidelines. Issues must:

- Follow the approved title format
- Use the required content template
- Include clearly defined acceptance criteria
- Specify urgency and difficulty

Issues may involve documentation, research, feature definition, lecture topic tasks, or coordination work.

For documentation scaffold sections specifically, issues must reference the master documentation scaffold issue (#53) to ensure traceability within the single compiled document structure.

Workflow:

1. Issue is created following the standardized template
2. Developer creates a feature branch
3. Developer modifies only the assigned scope
4. Pull request references the corresponding issue
5. CI workflow builds documentation artifacts automatically
6. Team Lead performs review
7. Manager approves and merges

No direct pushes to protected branches are permitted for non-admin users.

=== Milestone 1 Focus

Milestone 1 emphasizes:

- Clear scope definition (local Puerto Rico sports only)
- Explicit documentation of uncertainty and failure scenarios
- Mobile-first user interface expectations
- Transparency in data reliability and freshness
- Structured documentation before implementation

This structured team model ensures shared ownership, accountability, and disciplined engineering practices prior to any system development.
