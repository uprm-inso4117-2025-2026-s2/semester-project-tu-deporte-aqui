= Terminology

This section defines the official terminology used in Tu Deporte Aquí. These terms must be used consistently across documentation and future testing scenarios, especially when describing reliability, transparency, and uncertain information states.

== Verification Status Terms

*Confirmed*::
Information validated by an official or highly trusted source and considered accurate at the time of display.

*Unverified*::
Information reported by a single source or informal source without confirmation from an authoritative provider.

*Developing*::
Time-sensitive information that is still being verified and may change as more sources publish updates.

*Conflicting*::
A state where multiple sources report different values for the same event or field (e.g., score, status).

*Delayed*::
Information submitted significantly after the event occurred or updated slower than expected due to source latency.

*Corrected*::
Information that was previously published but later changed due to an official correction or reconciliation of conflicts.

== Confidence Level Terms

*High Confidence*::
Official source and no conflicts detected.

*Medium Confidence*::
Multiple non-official sources agree, but no official confirmation exists.

*Low Confidence*::
Single unverified source or conflicts detected between sources.

== Transparency Indicator Terms

*Publish Time*::
The time a report was first made visible to users.

*Last Updated Time*::
The most recent time the system updated the displayed information.

*Source Type*::
Classification of the origin of information (e.g., Official, Reporter, Community).

*Reliability Metadata*::
The combined set of fields that explain trustworthiness, including verification status, confidence level, timestamps, and source attribution.

== System State Terms

*Degraded State*::
A system condition where full functionality or complete data is not available due to source failures, partial outages, missing fields, or inconsistencies.

*Graceful Degradation*::
The system remains usable under partial failure by showing last known valid data and clearly communicating limitations instead of failing completely.

*Silent Failure*::
A failure where incorrect or missing information is presented without warning, explanation, or status messaging.
