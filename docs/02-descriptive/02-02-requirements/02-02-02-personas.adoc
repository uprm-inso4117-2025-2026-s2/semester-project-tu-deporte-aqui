Sebastian is a Puerto Rico sports fan who follows local leagues weekly and checks scores during games and playoffs.
He values speed and clarity, and he gets frustrated when different sources disagree or updates arrive late.

Goals::
* Quickly see game results, standings, and key updates in one place
* Know whether information is current and trustworthy during big events
* Avoid confusion when reports conflict

Pain points::
* Different pages and posts report different scores or update at different times
* During playoffs, sites lag or go down exactly when he needs them most
* When something is missing, he does not know if it is an error or just not posted yet

===== Persona B: Coach Abiel Rullan, the Team Organizer

He wants the platform to reflect reality and avoid spreading incorrect information about teams or players.

Goals::
* Confirm schedules and standings are accurate for his league
* Catch and correct errors quickly when something looks wrong
* Share trustworthy updates with players and parents

Pain points::
* Updates are often delayed and he has to double-check multiple sources
* Conflicting reports create arguments and confusion among teams and fans
* There is no clear way to tell if a result is verified or provisional

===== Persona C: Andres Perez, the Sports Reporter
Andres covers Puerto Rico sports and posts rapid updates, especially during tournaments and breaking news.
He needs a platform that can represent uncertainty cleanly when details are still developing.

Goals::
* Publish and reference updates without causing misinformation
* Make it clear when an update is preliminary vs confirmed
* Keep coverage stable during high-traffic moments

Pain points::
* Early reports may be incomplete, but the public wants immediate updates
* A single wrong post can spread fast if the platform does not handle conflicts well

He focuses on predictable behavior under failures, automation in testing, and clear user-facing status.

Goals::
* Prevent incorrect or outdated information from being shown as “final”
* Keep the system available during peak events
* Standardize reliability tests and integrate them into CI

Pain points::
* Most tests pass in normal conditions but do not cover failures and stress
